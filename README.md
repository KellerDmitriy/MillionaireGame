Technology stack:
1) In this application, recipe information is loaded using the API https://opentdb.com/
2) Architecture: MVP + Router. The project uses the MVP (Model-View-Presenter) architecture combined with the Router pattern for effective organization of the application components.
3) Programmatic UI: The entire interface and user experience of the application is implemented using programmatic UI, which provides more flexible interface management and development.
